INTRODUCTION
------------
ClutterBuster prevents items from being picked up from the world based on configurable blacklists
and whitelists.

ClutterBuster is the spiritual successor to another of my mods, QuickDrop. Where QuickDrop bandaged
over the issue of accidentally picking up dumb clutter by giving you hotkeys to quickly drop it,
ClutterBuster implements a more robust solution with the help of JContainers that actually prevents
the clutter from ever being picked up in the first place.

And thank god. Stupid dungeon clutter.
